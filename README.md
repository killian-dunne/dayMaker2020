This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To run this on your machine, clone the repo and make sure you've set up your environment as below.
Also, anywhere I have npm written here, yarn usually does the same thing if you have that installed instead.

## To Install

Check that you've got the following installed:
* npm https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm
* react (using npm)  
  `$ npm install react --save`  
  `$ npm install react-dom --save`

## To Run

Set up your environment by running the following commands on the terminal when you're in the root directory:
* `$ npm build`
* `$ npm install`
* Also, you'll need an API key and which I have mine saved in my `.env` file in the root directory. Ask me more if you need to. You might also need to put a `credentials.json` file in your root directory if you're not signing in with Google. I think I'll need to come back to this. 
* `$ npm start`
* Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser. It also autoreloads whenever you save changes in your IDE which is nice.
